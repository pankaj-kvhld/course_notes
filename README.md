# Muslim League Attack on Sikhs and Hindus in the Punjab 1947, S. GURBACHAN SINGH TALIB
This book was published in 1950 by Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Samiti. Mr. Talib was the principal of Lyallapur Khalsa colleage, Jallandhar. It not only records the painfully brutal uprooting of more than 7 million Sikhs and Hindus but also highlihgts the fact that this episode was the culmination of a decade long conspiracy of Muslim League. League perceived their presence in going to be muslim Pakistan as an impurity to be dealt with.

## Introduction

- Why Hindu India remains confused and even unconcerned? 

In answering this question, Mr. Ram Swarup states the following: "All this we believe partly because it involves doing nothing, anticipating nothing, planning nothing, and we can continue to live from day to day.  A more realistic and faithful appraisal will impose on us duties of a different kind and scope, duties which we therefore shirk.  We have learnt to live without thinking and we have got used to the idea of a shrunken and shrinking India.  We can now think of India without Afghanistan, without the North-West Frontier Province, without Punjab and Sind, without East Bengal, and we can do the same without Kashmir and other parts in the future.  Why assume avoidable responsibilities?

Or perhaps the sickness is deeper.  Long back, Sri Aurobindo saw the root cause of India's weakness, not in foreign yoke or poverty or dearth of spiritual experience, but in the decline of thinking power. Everywhere he saw inability or unwillingness to think, which is a sign of tragic decadence."

## Chapter 1 - Pakistan birth and objectives

- Dr. Muhammad Iqbal was the first one to put forward the idea of a separate nation of Pakistan, in the annual session of Muslim League. 

- Rehmat Ali circulated a pamphlate titles "Now or Never" in Jan 1933 in Cambridge which claimed that muslims are so different form hindus that they can no coexist with them. They neither  inter-dine nor inter-marry. He also conceptualized how this state might look like and what their respective names will be. Country including Asam and Bengal will be called Bangistan. Countries out of Bihar, U.P.,  Rajputana and Mopala region will be called `Farukistan`, `Haiderstan`, `Munistan` and `Mopalistan` respectively. These numerous muslim states will completely sorround the remaining non-muslim state from all sides and will gradually conquer it all in due time.
