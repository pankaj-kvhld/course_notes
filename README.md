# Inspiring and Motivating Individuals

## Developing a vision
1. Why do we exist?
2. What will our success look like? Who are our stake holders and how will they enjoy our success?
3. How must we act to ensure success?
  - Better to define hierarchy of values upfront, so as under heat correct decisions can be made. J&J's credo and how they acted in 1982 Tylenol situation.
  
## Communicating the vision
- asking rhetorical questions, which provoke thought. Ex. scene from dead poets society where Rob Williams asks the class "what your prose going to be?"
- the tree part list, tell what you are going to tell, tell them and thell what you have told them.
- inclusive language which builds community.
