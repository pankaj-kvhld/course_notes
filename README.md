# Muslim League Attack on Sikhs and Hindus in the Punjab 1947, S. GURBACHAN SINGH TALIB
This book was published in 1950 by Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Samiti. Mr. Talib was the principal of Lyallapur Khalsa colleage, Jallandhar. It not only records the painfully brutal uprooting of more than 7 million Sikhs and Hindus but also highlihgts the fact that this episode was the culmination of a decade long conspiracy of Muslim League. League perceived their presence in going to be muslim Pakistan as an impurity to be dealt with.

## Introduction

- Why Hindu India remains confused and even unconcerned? 

In answering this question, Mr. Ram Swarup states the following: "All this we believe partly because it involves doing nothing, anticipating nothing, planning nothing, and we can continue to live from day to day.  A more realistic and faithful appraisal will impose on us duties of a different kind and scope, duties which we therefore shirk.  We have learnt to live without thinking and we have got used to the idea of a shrunken and shrinking India.  We can now think of India without Afghanistan, without the North-West Frontier Province, without Punjab and Sind, without East Bengal, and we can do the same without Kashmir and other parts in the future.  Why assume avoidable responsibilities?

Or perhaps the sickness is deeper.  Long back, Sri Aurobindo saw the root cause of India's weakness, not in foreign yoke or poverty or dearth of spiritual experience, but in the decline of thinking power. Everywhere he saw inability or unwillingness to think, which is a sign of tragic decadence."

## Chapter 1 - Pakistan birth and objectives

- Dr. Muhammad Iqbal was the first one to put forward the idea of a separate nation of Pakistan, in the annual session of Muslim League held at Allahabad in the year 1930 . 

- Rehmat Ali circulated a pamphlet titles "Now or Never" in Jan 1933 in Cambridge which claimed that muslims are so different from hindus that they cannot coexist with them. They neither  inter-dine nor inter-marry. He also conceptualized how this new muslim state might look like and what their respective names will be. Country including Assam and Bengal will be called Bangistan. Countries out of Bihar, U.P.,  Rajputana and Mopala region will be called `Farukistan`, `Haiderstan`, `Munistan` and `Mopalistan` respectively. These numerous muslim states will completely sorround the remaining non-muslim state from all sides and will gradually conquer it all in due time. Although his designs never came to pass, but they did incite the hatred for non-muslims in the hearts of believers which to some extent was lying dormant.

- In its Patna annual session in 1938, muslim league passed a resolution stating that the time has come to authorize its working committee to decide and resort to `direct action`.

- In the 1941 annual session of Muslim league in Madras, the demand for separate Pakistan became much more vehement. Jinnah warned, "We do not want under any circumstances a constitution of All-India character with one Government at the centre.  We will never agree to that.  If you once agree to it, let me tell you that the Muslims would be absolutely wiped out of existence."

- This constant talk of muslims being wiped out of existence,  on its own is a reflection of the designs muslims have for non-muslims. Resistance, direct action and struggle these words have been the keynote of the Muslim League in defining its relations with Hindu India. 

- As early as 1938, Muslim league had started preparing for the violence that befell Hindus and Sikhs in 1946-47. They created two organizations namely, `Muslim League Volunteer Corp` and `Muslim National Guards`. The latter was much more dangerous and later converted to `Pakistan National Guards`.   They were collecting weapons and organizing training camps. They also hoarded petrol, which not only facilitated quick mobilization but also arson, evidence of the latter are the burned down villages left behind in both Punjab and Bengal. When in January, 1947 the Lahore office of the Muslim National Guards was raided by the Punjab police, a good deal of Military equipment including steel helmets and badges were recovered.  

    In April 1947, the Chief Secretary of Punjab reported to the Governor of Punjab that brisk training activity is underway and he estimated the strength of Muslim National League to be around 39000.
