# Muslim League Attack on Sikhs and Hindus in the Punjab 1947, S. GURBACHAN SINGH TALIB

## Chapter 1 - Introduction

- But Hindu India remains confused and even unconcerned? 

In answering this question, Mr. Ram Swarup states the following: "All this we believe partly because it involves doing nothing, anticipating nothing, planning nothing, and we can continue to live from day to day.  A more realistic and faithful appraisal will impose on us duties of a different kind and scope, duties which we therefore shirk.  We have learnt to live without thinking and we have got used to the idea of a shrunken and shrinking India.  We can now think of India without Afghanistan, without the North-West Frontier Province, without Punjab and Sind, without East Bengal, and we can do the same without Kashmir and other parts in the future.  Why assume avoidable responsibilities?

Or perhaps the sickness is deeper.  Long back, Sri Aurobindo saw the root cause of India's weakness, not in foreign yoke or poverty or dearth of spiritual experience, but in the ï¿½decline of thinking power. Everywhere he saw inability or unwillingness to think, which is a sign of tragic decadence."
